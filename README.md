### Hi there 👋

I'm a Laravel developer by day, serial side project abandoner by night. Lately, I've been spending my free time making [games 🎮](https://nathanheffley.itch.io/) for the [Playdate](https://play.date/).

[Laravel Slack Blocks](https://github.com/nathanheffley/laravel-slack-blocks) has been stable and running in production for a while now. Go check it out if you want to level-up the Slack messages your application sends.

[Laravel Watermelon 🍉](https://github.com/nathanheffley/laravel-watermelon) is a new project that I'm hoping will make it a breeze for Laravel developers to integrate [Watermelon DB](https://nozbe.github.io/WatermelonDB/) into their applications. If you need easy offline data storage in your web or mobile apps, check out Watermelon DB and this package to get up and running quickly.
