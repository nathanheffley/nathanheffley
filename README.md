### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently building internal tools for [Dealer Inspire](https://www.dealerinspire.com/) by day and developing Laravel packages by night.

[Laravel Slack Blocks](https://github.com/nathanheffley/laravel-slack-blocks) has been stable and running in production for a while now. Go check it out if you want to level-up the Slack messages your application sends.

[Laravel Watermelon](https://github.com/nathanheffley/laravel-watermelon) is a new project that I'm hoping will make it a breeze for Laravel developers to integrate [Watermelon DB](https://nozbe.github.io/WatermelonDB/) into their applications. If you need easy offline data storage in your web or mobile apps, check out Watermelon DB and this package to get up and running quickly.
